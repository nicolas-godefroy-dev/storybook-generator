A new _unsaved_ file will be created with the basics of a Storybook story in the Component Story Format (CSF) filled out for you. Move between the placeholders with TAB, customize the names as you want and you are done.

The extension will try to understand the properties it takes filling them out for you with some placeholders, or a default value if available.
